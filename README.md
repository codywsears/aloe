# Aloe

Resource Allocation Tool <br />
Aloe to protect you from resource allocation errors and provide an easy way to put resources in buckets.
Original intent is to organize backpacking trips. There is a need to minimize what is brought while ensuring all the essentials end up at camp.

## Development Configuration
Will need to create a config.js file with the necessary api keys for this project.
